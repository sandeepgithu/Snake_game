# Game Features

Fruit Spawn: The fruit (apple) spawns at a random position on the grid.

Collision Detection: The game checks if the snake eats the fruit or collides with the walls or itself.

Score Display: The score is displayed in the top-right corner of the screen, showing how many fruits the snake has eaten.

Sound Effects: A crunch sound plays when the snake eats a fruit.

Graphics: The snake's head, body, and tail have distinct graphics for different directions.
